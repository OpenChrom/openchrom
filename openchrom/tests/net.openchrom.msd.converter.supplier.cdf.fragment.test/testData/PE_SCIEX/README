README
There are five NetCDF data files on this disk :
CONTINUM.CDF
CENTSCNH.CDF
CENTSCNL.CDF
CENTSIDH.CDF
CENTSIDL.CDF

The instrument used for the experiments is a PE SCIEX API III system,
which includes the API III LC/MS/MS and an Apple Macintosh II series
computer.  The API III data files are converted on a Macintosh IIfx
computer by the PE-SCIEX FileTranslator program.

The original files were in API III format.  FileTranslator is a
software based on NetCDF 2.3.2 and AIA_MS 101 libraries.  It was
developed using THINK C 6.0 under System 7.

Currently, this program can convert files containing experimental
data.  Since the API III system does not handle library files at this
stage, this type of file is not converted by FileTranslator.  Only
LC/MS data files are converted.  The API III LC/MS/MS data files are
not converted.

For any problems with these files,  please contact:
