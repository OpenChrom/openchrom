General notes:

None of the files on this disk are compressed.  The reason for this is
that the CONTINUM.CDF file did not compress enough to make much difference,
and the other files are so small in relation to it that it didn't make
sense to compress them.


Test 1, file CONTINUM.CDF: this file contains one scan of benzene and one
scan of toluene (high-resolution, continuum FTMS spectra take up a large
amount of disk space, which limited this file to two scans).  The most
prominent peaks in the scan of benzene are at m/z 52, 77, and 78.  The most
prominent peaks in the scan of toluene are at m/z 65, 91, and 92.  The mass
and intensity data are in high-resolution format.

Test 2, file CENTSCNL.CDF: this file contains five scans of pftba, with
an experimental parameter increased with each scan.  The most prominent
peaks in each scan are at m/z 69, 131, and 219.  The mass and intensity
data are in low-resolution format.

Test 3, file CENTSCNH.CDF: this is the same as the file for test 2, except
that the mass and intensity data are in high-resolution format.

Test 4, file CENTSIDL.CDF: this file contains nine scans of pftba, monitoring
masses 69, 219, 264, 414, and 502, with an experimental parameter increased
with each scan.  The mass and intensity data are in low-resolution format.
This file contains no scan group information.

Test 5, file CENTSIDH.CDF: this is the same as the file for test 5, except
that the mass and intensity data are in high-resolution format.

Test 6, file LIBRARY.CDF: this file contains two spectra.  The first is
a spectrum of benzene (as in test 1, except in centroided form).  The second
is a spectrum of toluene (as in test 1, except in centroided form).  Both
scans contain only the minimum library information (the library entry name).
The mass and intensity data are in low-resolution format.
