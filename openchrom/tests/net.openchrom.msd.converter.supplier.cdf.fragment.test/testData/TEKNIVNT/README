        NOTE: this version should have the correct endian byte order

      The files on this diskette were converted from Teknivent Corp.
   Vector/Two (tm) data system files into the AIA netCDF format.
   This diskette should contain the following files:

        README.TXT      This file

        CONTINUM.CDF    A file of multiple-scan continuum high-resolution
                        data converted from n50allch.tkf, a Teknivent
                        Scan Raw file.

        CENTSCNL.CDF    A file of multiple-scan centroided low-resolution
                        (integer mass) data converted from umfc43.tkf, a
                        Teknivent Scan file.

        CENTSIDL.CDF    A file of multiple-scan centroided low-resolution
                        Selected Ion Detection data converted from data.tkf,
                        a Teknivent SIM file (This file was originally
                        acquired on a Teknivent Vector/One data system, and
                        was converted to the Vector/Two data format).


      The Vector/Two data system and the utilities that convert files to
   and from the netCDF format both run on OS/2 (version 1.3 or higher).
