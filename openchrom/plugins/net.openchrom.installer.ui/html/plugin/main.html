<h1>Installer</h1>
This wizard is designed to ease the installation of additional plug-ins for OpenChrom.
<h2>Converters</h2>
<p>File format converters are required to open instrument software generated files. These are usually stored in proprietary binary format. Where and how the raw data contents are to be found has been carefully reverse engineered. Clean room reverse engineering is a legal yet very expensive way to gain knowledge on these data structures. Therefore, Lablicate GmbH reserves the right that these additional software plug-ins shall only be used with OpenChrom. Redistribution is prohibited. However, for end-users the converters are free to use including for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>If your file is not completely parsed or the file format your instrument vendor uses is not in this list feel free to contact <a href="mailto:support@lablicate.com">support@lablicate.com</a> so we can privately exchange test data.</p>
