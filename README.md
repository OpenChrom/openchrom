# OpenChrom®

[OpenChrom®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenChrom) is an Open Source tool for the analysis and visualization of mass spectrometric and chromatographic data developed by [Lablicate GmbH](https://lablicate.com).

It is based on [ChemClipse](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse) but offers additional features that cannot be part of the ChemClipse project due to licencing constrains. This is the free base version provided to the community. It does not contain vendor specific file format converters nor commercial extensions.
